# image processing from scratch

## what is this?
This repository contains many interesting image processing algorithms that are written from scratch. Read these codes will allow you to have a comprehensive understanding of the principles of these algorithms. I also have video tutorials for these algorithms [here](https://space.bilibili.com/14672002). Go check out if you know Chinese :-)  

<strong>Implementation</strong>  
All codes were wrote in python3.7 or c++  
moudles you may need:  
python: 
- numpy for matix calculation  
- matplotlib for reading and showing images  
- opencv2 for some image operations  
c++:  
- opencv2  

<strong>Usage</strong>  
you can always run a python script just by  
`python script.py`  
for c++, you need to compile first  
`cd build`  
`cmake ..`  
`make`  
when it's done, you are ready to run the execuatable by  
`./Main`  
Just make sure you have the images in the right path, and you might wanna modify the code a bit to process another image.  
<strong>Have fun!</strong>
