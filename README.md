# image processing from scratch

## what is this?
This repository contains many interesting image processing algorithms that are written from scratch. Read these codes will allow you to have a comprehensive understanding of the principles of these algorithms. I also have video tutorials for these algorithms [here](https://space.bilibili.com/14672002). Go check out if you know Chinese :-)

### All codes were wrote in python3.7 or c++

moudles you may need:
<strong>python:</strong>
-        numpy for matix calculation
-        matplotlib for reading and showing images
-       opencv2 for some image operations
<strong>c++:</strong>
-        opencv2

Have fun.
